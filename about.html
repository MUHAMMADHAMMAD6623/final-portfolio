        <div class="about-desc">
            <p>Hey there! I'm Hammad, a passionate front-end developer with a love for creating beautiful and functional
                websites. My journey into the world of web development began with a simple curiosity about how websites
                work, and over time, it has grown into a deep passion. I'm constantly learning, experimenting, and
                improving my skills, whether it's building responsive layouts, optimizing performance, or crafting
                seamless user experiences.</p>
            <p>At just 13 years old, I dove headfirst into the exciting world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, crafting my
                first websites from scratch. From understanding how to structure web pages to making them visually
                appealing, I found joy in every line of code I wrote. As I grew, so did my ambition and curiosity,
                pushing me to explore more advanced tools and technologies. WordPress became a significant part of my
                toolkit, allowing me to expand into the world of dynamic and content-driven websites, where I learned to
                create custom themes, optimize user experiences, and offer versatility to businesses.</p>

        <div class="my-journey">
            <p style="font-weight: 600;">My Journey includes:</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Learning HTML & CSS</h3>
            I started learning the basics of HTML and CSS at a young age, experimenting with simple websites and
            layouts. Understanding how structure and style come together was an exciting discovery for me.
            <h3>Getting Deeper into JavaScript</h3>

            After mastering the essentials of HTML and CSS, I moved on to JavaScript. This opened up a whole new realm
            of possibilities—interactivity, dynamic content, and the ability to make websites truly come to life.
            <h3>Exploring WordPress</h3>

            As my skills grew, I ventured into WordPress, learning how to create custom themes, design layouts, and
            manage content efficiently. WordPress allowed me to take static websites to a more dynamic and user-friendly
            level.
            <h3>Building React Applications</h3>

            React was my next big challenge. Learning its component-based structure, hooks, and state management
            concepts helped me build powerful single-page applications. React brought structure to my projects and
            allowed me to optimize performance.
            <h3>Working on Projects</h3>

            Throughout my journey, I’ve worked on numerous personal projects—ranging from a todo list with localStorage
            integration, to a password strength checker, to creating dynamic calculators for vinyl and other materials.
            Each project has contributed to my learning and growth as a developer.
